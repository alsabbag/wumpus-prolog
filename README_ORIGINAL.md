I have found quite a lot of implementations already existing that time, but non of them were working how I wanted to represent the problem.

You can find all these sources under the `res` directory, written by:

* [Larry Holder](mailto:holder@cse.uta.edu)
* [Nicolas Hernandez](http://archives.limsi.fr/Individu/hernandz/)

Hope they do not mind if I attach their code as well for comparison and reference.
